# **Game Title**

_(Enter your game's title here.)_
_(Add some screenshots here showcasing your game)_

## **How to Run**

- System requirements: Operating System, controls, etc
- Unity Version: X.Y.Z
- **Executable file** of the game to download _(Ensure it is playable without extra setup.)_

### Gameplay Recording

You should provide a link to your **Full gameplay recording** showing mechanics, UI/UX, and polish. _(A complete playthrough is required.)_ here.

## Chosen Theme

_(State your **chosen theme** clearly here. This will affect how we grade your work)_

## Game Description

_(Briefly describe your game’s premise, setting, and goal. What is the game about? What experience should the player have?)_

## **Core Mechanic**

_(What is the core mechanic? Use the core mechanics described in class. Then you can describe the main action players perform repeatedly that drives gameplay. Example: "Jumping between platforms to avoid obstacles" or "Controlling a spaceship to dodge and shoot enemies.")_

## **Game Procedure & Controls**

_(How does the player navigate the game? What are the controls? Provide a list of inputs and their functions.)_

Example:

- **Arrow Keys / WASD** – Move character
- **Spacebar** – Jump
- **Left Mouse Click** – Attack

## **Core Drive (Tally with Design Principles, Balance, and Intentional Design)**

_(What **motivates** the player to engage with your game? Relate this to the Octalysis Framework or other motivational principles.)_

### **Examples of Core Drives:**

- **Epic Meaning & Purpose**: Does the game make players feel like they are part of something greater?
- **Development & Accomplishment**: Are there clear goals and a sense of progress?
- **Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback**: Can players experiment, make choices, and receive meaningful feedback?
- **Ownership & Possession**: Do players feel invested in their progress, character, or world?
- **Social Influence & Relatedness**: Does the game foster interaction, competition, or cooperation?
- **Scarcity & Impatience**: Does limited access to resources create meaningful decisions?
- **Unpredictability & Curiosity**: Does the game encourage exploration or surprise the player?
- **Loss & Avoidance**: Are players driven by the fear of losing progress or failing?

_(Choose ONE core drive that influenced your design and explain how they shape player engagement.)_

## **Game Balance Efforts (Tally with Rubric)**

_(What balance considerations were made in the game? Did you focus on PvP balance, PvE balance, asymmetry, statistical balance, risk vs. reward, skill balance, or economic balance? Explain how you implemented or adjusted game balance.)_

Example:

- **Risk vs. Reward**: High-risk areas provide more power-ups, rewarding skilled players
- **PvE Balance**: Enemy difficulty scales gradually, ensuring a fair challenge.
- **Asymmetry**: Two players have different abilities but are balanced through unique strengths and weaknesses.

## **Unique Rule (Tally with Rubric)**

_(What unique rule did you introduce? Did you apply an elegant rule, break a conventional rule, or create asymmetry? Describe how this rule impacts gameplay and how it aligns with the rubric.)_

Example:

- **Breaking a Rule**: In a platformer, players cannot jump but must rely on environment-based movement.
- **Asymmetry**: The player controls two characters with different abilities, requiring strategic switching.

## **Game Design Principles Incorporated**

_(Which design principles from class were intentionally applied? List at least one and explain how it enhances the player’s experience.)_

Example:

- **Grounding the Player**: The environment provides strong visual cues to help players understand mechanics naturally.
- **Meaningful Choices**: Players must decide between fighting stronger enemies for rewards or avoiding them for safety.
- **Player Empathy**: The story and mechanics are designed to create an emotional connection with the character.

## Code Cleanliness Efforts (Bonus)

_Outline your code architecture here and attempt to organise your code that suits your game. Be concise and clear. Leave this section blank if you are not doing this bonus part._
